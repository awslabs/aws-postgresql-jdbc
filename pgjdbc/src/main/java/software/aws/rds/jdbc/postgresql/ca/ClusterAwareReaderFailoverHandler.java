/**
 * An implementation of ReaderFailoverHandler.
 *
 * <p>The goal of the reader failover process is to connect to any available reader. In order to connect
 * faster, this implementation tries to connect to two readers at the same time. The first
 * successfully connected reader is returned as the process result. If both readers are unavailable
 * (i.e. could not be connected to), the process picks up another pair of readers and repeats. If no
 * reader connection has successfully been established, the process may consider connecting to a writer host, and other
 * hosts marked as down.
